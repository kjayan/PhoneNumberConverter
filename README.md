PhoneNumberConverter
====================

A java project which converts the phone numbers into meaningful words which can be remembered easily.

Many companies like to list their phone numbers using the letters printed on most
telephones. This makes the number easier to remember for customers. An example may
be 1-800-FLOWERS
This problem is to write a program that will show a user possible matches for a list
of provided phone numbers.
The program should be a command line application that reads from files specified as
command-line arguments or STDIN when no files are given. Each line of these files will
contain a single phone number.
For each phone number read, your program should output all possible word replacements
from a dictionary. Your program should try to replace every digit of the provided phone
number with a letter from a dictionary word; however, if no match can be made, a single
digit can be left as is at that point. No two consecutive digits can remain unchanged and
the program should skip over a number (producing no output) if a match cannot be made.
Your program should allow the user to set a dictionary with the -d command-line option,
but it's fine to use a reasonable default for your system. The dictionary is expected to have
one word per line.
All punctuation and whitespace should be ignored in both phone numbers and the
dictionary file. The program should not be case sensitive, letting "a" == "A". Output should
be capital letters and digits separated at word boundaries with a single dash (-), one
possible word encoding per line. 

For example, if your program is fed the number:
! 2255.63

One possible line of output is
! CALL-ME
According to the dictionary.
